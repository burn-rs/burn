# Modified UNet
A burn implementation of a modified form of UNet (convolutional neural network) for image segmentation. This work is based on the original paper _U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation_^1^ [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597). For more information about the model architecture in this implementation, see [MODEL ARCHITECTURE](./MODEL_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Usage
